## Welcome to my GitHub Pages site

### This site contains links to my Shiny apps that deal with biochemistry, particularly in relation to heamostasis and the clotting and lysis of fibrin.

The first Shiny app I developed was designed to facilitate the analysis of clotting and lysis curves, such as the one shown below.

This is a link to the online app [clotlysis_2019](https://drclongstaff.shinyapps.io/clotlysisCL_2019)

The output from a set of clot lysis curves is shown here, along with the results for the time to 50% clot lysis.
