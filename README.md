## Welcome to my GitHub Pages site

### This site contains links to my Shiny apps that deal with biochemistry, particularly in relation to haemostasis and the clotting and lysis of fibrin.

#### These are the apps available



The first Shiny app I developed was designed to facilitate the analysis of fibrin clotting and lysis curves, such as the one shown below.

This is a link to the online app, please try it out. [clotlysis_2019](https://drclongstaff.shinyapps.io/clotlysisCL_2019)

The output from a set of clot lysis curves is shown here, along with the results for the time to 50% clot lysis. The app makes it easy to extract selected parameters from these curves, such as time to a chosen % lysis, maximum absorbance, area under the curve, etc.

Options are provided for baseline selection and curve fitting to facilitate reproducible, high throughput analysis
